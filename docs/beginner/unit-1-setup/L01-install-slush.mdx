# Install Slush Wallet

The first step to using Sui is installing a wallet. Don't worry—it's super easy! Just follow the clicks and you'll be done in about 5 minutes.

## What's Slush Wallet?

Slush (formerly "Sui Wallet") is a browser wallet for Sui, made by Mysten Labs. With this, you can do all sorts of things.<br/>
For example:

- Create and manage accounts (addresses)
- Sign transactions
- Connect to dApps (decentralized apps)
- Switch between networks (Mainnet/Testnet, etc.)

:::tip Why Slush?
There are several wallets for Sui, but we'll use Slush in this tutorial! It's close to an official wallet and supports Sui-specific features like sponsored transactions.

## Let's Install the Chrome Extension

First, let's add Slush to Chrome.

1. Go to the Chrome Web Store
   - [Slush - Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/slush-a-sui-wallet/opcgpfmipidbgpenhmajoajpbobppdil)

2. Make sure the developer is "✓ slush.app", then click "**Add to Chrome**"

## Let's Create an Account

Slush has two methods: "Social Login" (Google/Apple/Facebook/Twitch) and "Passphrase". Here, we'll use the **Passphrase method** since it's easier to migrate to other wallets later.

1. After installation, the Slush welcome screen opens automatically

2. Click "More options" at the bottom

3. Select "Create a passphrase account"

## Let's Save Your Passphrase

1. You'll see 12 English words (your passphrase)

2. Write them down on paper

:::danger Keep your passphrase safe!
Never share your passphrase with anyone! If someone has it, they can access your wallet. Write it down on paper and keep it somewhere safe.

## Let's Set Up Password & Security

1. Set a password
   - Use alphanumeric characters + symbols, and make it as long as possible

2. The `Protect your wallet with additional security` screen appears.<br/>
   Configure as you like and click "Next"
   - **Unlock your wallet**: Auto-lock timeout (15min to 1 day)
   - **Confirm transactions**: Require password for each transaction

3. Now the wallet main screen appears!

## Did It Work?

Open `Settings` in your wallet—if you see your **address**, you're all set!

Your address is a long string starting with `0x` (e.g., `0x1234...abcd`).
