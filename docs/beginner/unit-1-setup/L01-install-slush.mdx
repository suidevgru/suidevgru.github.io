## What is Slush Wallet?

Slush (formerly known as "Sui Wallet") is a browser wallet for the Sui blockchain, developed by Mysten Labs. It provides the following features:

- Generate and manage accounts (addresses)
- Sign transactions
- Connect to dApps
- Switch between networks (Mainnet/Testnet, etc.)

:::tip Why Slush?
There are several wallets available for Sui, but this tutorial uses Slush. It's close to an official wallet and supports Sui-specific features like sponsored transactions.

## Step 1: Install Chrome Extension

1. Go to the Chrome Web Store
   - [Slush - Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/slush-a-sui-wallet/opcgpfmipidbgpenhmajoajpbobppdil)

2. Verify that the developer is "✓ slush.app" before adding

## Step 2: Create Account

Slush offers two account creation methods: "Social Login" (Google/Apple/Facebook/Twitch) and "Passphrase". In this lesson, we'll use the **Passphrase Account** method, which makes it easier to migrate to other wallets later.

1. After installation, the Slush welcome screen will automatically open

2. Click "More options" at the bottom

3. Select "Create a passphrase account"

## Step 3: Store Passphrase

1. A passphrase (12 words) will be displayed

2. Write down the displayed passphrase

:::danger Keep your passphrase safe
Never share your passphrase with anyone. Anyone with this phrase can access your wallet. We recommend writing it down on paper and storing it in a safe place.
:::

## Step 4: Password and Security Settings

1. Set a password
   - Follow the on-screen requirements (alphanumeric + symbols recommended, longer is better)

2. "Protect your wallet with additional security" screen appears
   - **Unlock your wallet**: Set auto-lock timeout (15min to 1 day)
   - **Confirm transactions**: Require password for transactions
   - Configure as preferred and click "Next"

3. Once confirmed, the wallet main screen will be displayed

## Success Check

You have succeeded if your **address** is displayed in the wallet `Settings`.

The address is a long hexadecimal string starting with `0x` (typically `0x` + 64 digits, e.g., `0x1234...abcd`).

:::tip Copy Address
Click on the address to copy it to your clipboard. You'll use this in later lessons.
