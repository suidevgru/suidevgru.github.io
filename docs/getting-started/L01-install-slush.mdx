# Install Slush Wallet

The first step to using Sui is installing a wallet. It's straightforward—just follow the on-screen instructions and you'll be done in about 5 minutes.

## What is Slush Wallet?

Slush (formerly "Sui Wallet") is a browser wallet for Sui, made by Mysten Labs. With Slush, you can:

- Create and manage accounts (addresses)
- Sign transactions
- Connect to dApps (decentralized apps)
- Switch between networks (Mainnet/Testnet, etc.)

:::tip Why Slush?
There are several wallets for Sui, but this tutorial uses Slush. It's close to an official wallet and supports Sui-specific features like sponsored transactions.

## Install the Chrome Extension

First, add Slush to Chrome.

1. Go to the Chrome Web Store
   - [Slush - Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/slush-a-sui-wallet/opcgpfmipidbgpenhmajoajpbobppdil)

2. Make sure the developer is "✓ slush.app", then click "**Add to Chrome**"

## Create an Account

Slush has two methods: "Social Login" (Google/Apple/Facebook/Twitch) and the recovery phrase method. Here, we'll use the **recovery phrase method** (Passphrase account) since it's easier to migrate to other wallets later.

1. After installation, the Slush welcome screen opens automatically

2. Click "More options" at the bottom

## Save Your Recovery Phrase

1. You'll see 12 English words (your recovery phrase, also called seed phrase)

2. Write them down on paper and store them safely

:::danger Keep your recovery phrase safe
Your recovery phrase (seed phrase) is the "key" to your wallet.

- Never share it with anyone.
- Do not take screenshots or store it in chats, emails, or cloud notes.
- Write it down on paper and store it offline in a safe place.

## Set Up Password and Security

1. Set a password
   - Use alphanumeric characters + symbols, and make it as long as possible

2. The `Protect your wallet with additional security` screen appears.<br/>
   Configure as you like and click "Next"
   - **Unlock your wallet**: Auto-lock timeout (15min to 1 day)
   - **Confirm transactions**: Require password for each transaction

3. Once setup is complete, the wallet main screen will appear.

## Verify Success

Open `Settings` in your wallet—if you see your **address**, you're all set.

Your address is a long string starting with `0x` (e.g., `0x1234...abcd`).
