# Switch to Devnet

Once your wallet is ready, let's switch to a development network. This is a quick setup that takes less than 2 minutes.

## What is Devnet?

Sui has multiple networks:

- **Mainnet** — The production environment. Handles real assets.
- **Testnet** — The staging environment. Ideal for pre-production verification and integration testing.
- **Devnet** — The development environment. Ideal for experimenting and iterating freely.

In this tutorial, we'll use **Devnet**. You can get free test SUI tokens on any network.

:::tip Why use Devnet?
Devnet is great for learning because you can easily get test SUI (gas) from the Faucet via Sui CLI.<br/>
(Testnet's Faucet can sometimes have delays due to heavy traffic or rate limiting.)<br/>
Note: Devnet is reset relatively frequently. Use Testnet if you need to preserve work long-term.
