# Switch to Devnet

Once your wallet is ready, let's switch to a development network. This is a quick setup that takes less than 2 minutes.

## What is Devnet?

Sui has multiple networks:

- **Mainnet** — The production environment. Handles real assets.
- **Testnet** — The staging environment. Ideal for pre-production verification and integration testing.
- **Devnet** — The development environment. Ideal for experimenting and iterating freely.

In this tutorial, we'll use **Devnet**.

Devnet is a network designed for development and learning, where you can get **free test SUI (gas) as many times as you need**.
You can experiment hands-on and learn through trial and error, making it perfect for beginners exploring Sui for the first time.

Note that **Mainnet** is the production environment that handles real SUI with actual value.
We won't use Mainnet in this tutorial, so feel free to proceed with Devnet.

:::tip Why use Devnet?
Devnet is great for learning because you can easily get test SUI (gas) from the Faucet via Sui CLI.<br/>
(Testnet's Faucet can sometimes have delays due to heavy traffic or rate limiting.)<br/>
Note: Devnet is reset relatively frequently. Use Testnet if you need to preserve work long-term.
:::

## What is the Faucet?

A **Faucet** is a service that provides free test tokens for gas fees on Devnet and Testnet.
You can get them from the [Sui Faucet](https://faucet.sui.io/) or via CLI.

We'll cover how to use the Faucet in detail in [Get Test Tokens](./L06-get-test-tokens).
