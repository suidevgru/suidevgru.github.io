# Install Sui CLI

Let's install the Sui CLI (command-line tools). **It's not difficult**—just follow the steps.

## What is Sui CLI?

Sui CLI is a tool for interacting with the Sui blockchain from your terminal.

- Build and deploy Move contracts
- Send transactions
- Inspect objects
- Get test tokens from the Faucet

It supports all these development tasks.

## Install Suiup

We'll use **Suiup**, the official Sui CLI version manager. It works like `rustup` for Rust, making it easy to manage multiple versions.

<details>
<summary>macOS / Linux</summary>

1. **Open your terminal and run the following command**

   ```bash
   curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MystenLabs/suiup/main/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Close and reopen your terminal**

   (If `suiup` is not found, check that `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH)

3. **Verify the installation**

   ```bash
   suiup --version
   ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows (PowerShell)</summary>

On Windows, you download `suiup.exe` from Releases and place it in a folder that's in your PATH.

1. **Download `suiup`**

    Go to [Suiup Releases](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suiup/releases) and download the Windows zip file.
    Choose the correct version for your CPU (most PCs are `x86_64`, some like Surface are `arm64`).

    - Example: `suiup-Windows-msvc-x86_64.zip` / `suiup-Windows-msvc-arm64.zip`


2. **Extract the zip and get `suiup.exe`**

3. **Create a `bin` folder**

    Run the following command.

   ```powershell
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\bin"
   ```

4. **Move `suiup.exe` to `bin`**

5. **Add to PATH**

    Run the following command.

   ```powershell
   $userPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
   if (-not $userPath) { $userPath = "" }
   if ($userPath -notlike "*$env:USERPROFILE\bin*") {
     [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$userPath;$env:USERPROFILE\bin", "User")
   }
   ```

6. **Close and reopen PowerShell**

7. **Verify the installation**
   ```powershell
   suiup --version
   ```

</details>

## Install Sui CLI

Once Suiup is ready, install Sui CLI. Since we're using Devnet in this tutorial, install the Devnet version.

```bash
suiup install sui@devnet -y
```

:::tip Network-specific versions
- `sui@devnet` — For development (used in this tutorial)
- `sui@testnet` — For testing
- `sui@mainnet` — For production

Note: If you omit the version like `suiup install sui`, testnet is selected by default.

## Verify Installation

After installation, check the version.

```bash
sui --version
```

If you see a version number, you're all set.

```
sui 1.x.x-xxxxxxx
```

You can also check installed versions with `suiup show`.

```bash
suiup show
```

:::warning If the version doesn't show
If you see `command not found`, try closing and reopening your terminal. If that doesn't work, check your path settings.
