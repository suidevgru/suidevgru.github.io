# Install Sui Extension for VSCode

Let's install the **Sui Extension** in VSCode to set up your Move development environment. With this extension, you can compile, deploy, and test contracts—all within VSCode.

It's not difficult. Just install the extension and log in with your Google account (you'll need a Google account, but it's free to use).

## What is Sui Extension?

Sui Extension is a VSCode extension for Sui development, created by [zktx.io](https://zktx.io/).

- **zkLogin Wallet** — Create a wallet with your Google account (Devnet/Testnet supported)
- **Compile, Deploy, Test** — Manage Move projects within VSCode
- **Package Explorer** — View and interact with deployed contracts
- **Object Explorer** — Inspect Sui objects
- **PTB-Builder** — Visually construct transactions
- **Templates** — Start projects quickly with 30+ Move templates

In this tutorial, we'll use Sui Extension to deploy and test contracts.

:::tip Difference from Slush Wallet
The **Slush** wallet you set up in L01-L02 and the **zkLogin wallet** in this extension are separate.

- **Slush** — Use when interacting with dApps in your browser
- **zkLogin (Sui Extension)** — Use when deploying and testing contracts in VSCode

You'll use both during development. Think of it as separating your "user wallet" from your "developer wallet."
