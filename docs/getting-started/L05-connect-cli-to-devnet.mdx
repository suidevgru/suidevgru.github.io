# Connect CLI to Devnet

Let's connect the Sui CLI you installed in [Install Sui CLI](./L03-install-sui-cli.mdx) to Devnet. **It's not difficult**—just run a few commands and you're done.

:::info
You only need to do this setup once.
:::

## Initial Sui CLI Setup

When using Sui CLI for the first time, you need to run the initial setup. Running `sui client` will automatically start the setup process.

```bash
sui client
```

On the first run, you'll see the following prompt:

```
Config file ["/home/user/.sui/sui_config/client.yaml"] doesn't exist, do you want to connect to a Sui Full node server [y/N]?
```

Type **`y`** and press Enter.

Next, you'll be asked to choose a network:

```
Sui Full node server URL (Defaults to Sui Devnet if not specified) :
```

**Just press Enter** here (Devnet is selected by default).

Then, choose a key type:

```
Select key scheme to generate keypair (0 for ed25519, 1 for secp256k1, 2 for secp256r1):
```

Type **`0`** (ed25519) and press Enter.

The initial setup is now complete, and a new address has been automatically created.

## Connect to Devnet

After the initial setup, let's verify that you're connected to Devnet.

```bash
sui client active-env
```

If it shows `devnet`, you're already connected to Devnet.

If a different network is shown (e.g., `testnet`), switch to Devnet with the following command:

```bash
sui client switch --env devnet
```

:::tip View available networks
Use `sui client envs` to see all configured networks.

```bash
sui client envs
```

```

## Check Your Address

Let's check the address associated with your CLI.

```bash
sui client active-address
```

You'll see an address starting with `0x`:

```
0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
```

This is your Sui CLI wallet address.

## Verify Success

You're all set if you can confirm the following:

- `sui client active-env` returns `devnet`
- `sui client active-address` shows an address (`0x...`)
