# Connect CLI to Devnet

Let's connect the Sui CLI you installed in [Install Sui CLI](./L03-install-sui-cli.mdx) to Devnet. **It's not difficult**—just run a few commands and you're done.

:::info
You only need to do this setup once.
:::

## Initial Sui CLI Setup

When using Sui CLI for the first time, you need to run the initial setup. Run the following command:

```bash
sui client envs
```

### First-Time Setup (No Config File)

If you see the following message, initial setup is required:

```
No sui config found in `/home/user/.sui/sui_config/client.yaml`, create one [Y/n]?
```

Type **`y`** and press Enter. A keypair (address) will be automatically generated and the setup will complete.

```
y
Generated new keypair and alias for address with scheme "ed25519" [alias: 0x...]
  secret recovery phrase : [word1 word2 word3 ...]
Created "/home/user/.sui/sui_config/client.yaml"
Set active environment to testnet

```

:::danger Keep your recovery phrase safe
Your `secret recovery phrase` (also called seed phrase) is the "key" to your wallet.

- Never share it with anyone.
- Do not take screenshots or store it in chats, emails, or cloud notes.
- Write it down on paper and store it offline in a safe place.
:::

### If Already Configured

If the network list appears without any prompt, the initial setup is already complete. Proceed to the next section.

---

## Connect to Devnet

The default after initial setup is **testnet**. Let's switch to Devnet.

```bash
sui client switch --env devnet
```

On success, you'll see:

```
Active environment switched to [devnet]
```

Verify the switch:

```bash
sui client active-env
```

If it shows `devnet`, you're all set.

:::tip View available networks
Use `sui client envs` to see all configured networks. The `*` in the `active` column indicates the current network.

## Check Your Address

Let's check the address associated with your CLI.

```bash
sui client active-address
```

You'll see an address starting with `0x`:

```
0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
```

This is your Sui CLI wallet address.

## Verify Success

You're all set if you can confirm the following:

- `sui client active-env` returns `devnet`
- `sui client active-address` shows an address (`0x...`)
