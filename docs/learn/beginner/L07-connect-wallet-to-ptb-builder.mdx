# Connect Wallet to PTB Builder

In this lesson, you'll connect your Slush wallet to PTB Builder. **It's not difficult**—follow the steps and you'll be done in a few minutes.

## What is PTB Builder?

**PTB Builder** is a developer tool that lets you visually build and execute Sui transactions (Programmable Transaction Blocks / PTBs).

Normally, creating transactions requires using the CLI or SDK, but with PTB Builder, you can assemble transactions simply by dragging and dropping blocks.

By connecting your wallet, you can:

- Use your own wallet address
- Sign the transactions you create
- Execute them on the actual blockchain

:::tip Flow of creating transactions with PTB Builder

### Two Ways to Use PTB Builder

There are two ways to use PTB Builder:

- **External site ([ptb.wal.app](https://ptb.wal.app/))**
  - Both Editor and Viewer functionality
  - Supports Devnet / Testnet / Mainnet
  - Use when you need full functionality

- **On-site demo ([PTB Builder Demo](/docs/live-code-example/ptb-builder))**
  - Editor functionality only
  - Devnet only
  - Used in future lessons after deploying Move modules

In this lesson, we'll learn wallet connection basics using the external site. In future lessons, we'll primarily use the on-site demo for convenience.
