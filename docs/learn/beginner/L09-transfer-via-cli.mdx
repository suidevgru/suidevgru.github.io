# Transfer via CLI

In this lesson, you'll learn how to send SUI tokens to another address using the Sui CLI. This is one of the most fundamental operations on a blockchain. With just one command, you can transfer tokens—it's not difficult!

:::tip Why learn CLI transfers?
While wallets provide a user-friendly interface, understanding CLI transfers allows you to:
- Automate transactions with scripts
- Test and debug your applications
- Gain a deeper understanding of transaction structure
:::

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lesson, make sure you have completed the following:

- Sui CLI installed (verify with `sui --version`) — [Install Sui CLI](/docs/getting-started/L03-install-sui-cli)
- CLI connected to Devnet (`sui client active-env` returns `devnet`) — [Connect CLI to Devnet](/docs/getting-started/L05-connect-cli-to-devnet)
- Test SUI obtained from Faucet (check balance with `sui client gas`) — [Get Test Tokens](/docs/getting-started/L06-get-test-tokens)

---

## Steps

### 1. Check your current address and balance

First, let's check your current address and SUI balance.

```bash
sui client active-address
```

You'll see your address displayed like this:
```
0x1234abcd...
```

Next, check your balance:

```bash
sui client gas
```

You'll see output like this:
```
╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────┬──────────────────╮
│ gasCoinId                                                          │ mistBalance (MIST) │ suiBalance (SUI) │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────┼──────────────────┤
│ 0xabcd1234...                                                      │ 1000000000         │ 1.00             │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────┴──────────────────╯
```

:::info MIST and SUI
1 SUI = 1,000,000,000 MIST (1 billion MIST). MIST is the smallest unit of SUI, similar to satoshi for Bitcoin.
:::

### 2. Get the recipient address

For the recipient, we'll use your Slush wallet address that you created in [Install Slush Wallet](/docs/getting-started/L01-install-slush).

The CLI address (generated in [Connect CLI to Devnet](/docs/getting-started/L05-connect-cli-to-devnet)) and the address you first created in Slush are **different addresses**. In this lesson, we'll send SUI from the CLI address to the Slush wallet address.

**How to find your Slush wallet address:**

1. Open the Slush browser extension
2. Click the user icon ① in the bottom right, then select "**Manage all**" ②
3. Switch to the account you created in [Install Slush Wallet](/docs/getting-started/L01-install-slush) (not the CLI account you imported in [Connect CLI to Devnet](/docs/getting-started/L05-connect-cli-to-devnet))
4. Copy the address (`0x...`)

![Open account management in Slush](./img/L09_slush-manage-accounts.png)

:::tip How to identify your addresses
If you have multiple accounts in Slush, you can switch between them using the user icon in the bottom right. The account that received SUI from the Faucet in [Get Test Tokens](/docs/getting-started/L06-get-test-tokens) (CLI address) will have a balance, while the account you first created in [Install Slush Wallet](/docs/getting-started/L01-install-slush) should have a balance of 0.
:::

### 3. Transfer SUI using PTB

Now let's send some SUI! Replace `<RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>` with the recipient's address:

```bash
sui client ptb \
  --split-coins gas "[1000000000]" \
  --assign coins \
  --transfer-objects "[coins]" @<RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> \
  --gas-budget 10000000
```

:::info Command explanation
- `--split-coins gas "[1000000000]"`: Splits 1000000000 MIST (= 1 SUI) from the gas coin. Using the `gas` keyword lets the CLI automatically select which coin to use
- `--assign coins`: Assigns the split coins to a variable called `coins`
- `--transfer-objects "[coins]" @<ADDRESS>`: Transfers `coins` to the specified address (note the `@` before the address; don't include the `<>`, replace with the actual address)
- `--gas-budget`: The **maximum** gas fee (in MIST). Only the amount actually used is consumed, and the rest is returned (e.g., 10000000 MIST = 0.01 SUI)
:::

:::tip What is PTB (Programmable Transaction Block)?
PTB is a powerful feature of Sui that allows you to combine multiple operations into a single transaction. In this case, we're performing two operations—"split coins → transfer"—in one transaction.
:::

When you run the command, you'll see detailed output like this:

```
Transaction Digest: AbC123xYz...
╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Transaction Data                                                                                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Sender: 0x1234abcd...                                                                           │
│ ...                                                                                             │
```

The **Transaction Digest** is the unique ID of your transaction. Make sure to copy this!

### 4. Verify the transaction

Let's confirm that the transaction was successful.

#### Check in Explorer

You can verify on Suiscan:

1. Go to [Suiscan (Devnet)](https://suiscan.xyz/devnet/home)
2. Make sure you're on **Devnet**
3. Paste the Transaction Digest in the search box
4. Confirm that the transaction shows "Success"

![Transaction confirmation on Suiscan](./img/L09_suiscan-success.png)

For more details on reading transactions in Explorer, see [Read Transactions in Explorer](/docs/learn/beginner/L08-read-tx-in-explorer).

#### Check in PTB Builder

You can use the Viewer feature in [PTB Builder](https://ptb.wal.app/) to visually inspect your transaction:

1. Go to [PTB Builder (ptb.wal.app)](https://ptb.wal.app/)
2. Set the network to **DEVNET** and connect Slush via "**Connect Wallet**"
3. Select "**Viewer**"
4. Paste the Transaction Digest in the search box
5. The transaction structure (SplitCoins → TransferObjects) will be displayed visually

![PTB Builder Viewer](./img/L09_ptb-builder-viewer.png)

For more details on using PTB Builder, see [Connect Wallet to PTB Builder](/docs/learn/beginner/L07-connect-wallet-to-ptb-builder).

### 5. Check balance changes

Finally, let's verify the transfer by checking the balances of both addresses.

**CLI address (sender) balance:**

```bash
sui client gas
```

Confirm that the balance has decreased from before (by the transfer amount + gas fee).

**Slush wallet address (recipient) balance:**

Open Slush and switch to the account you created in [Install Slush Wallet](/docs/getting-started/L01-install-slush). You should see the transferred SUI reflected in the balance.

![Check balance in Slush wallet](./img/L09_slush-balance.png)

:::tip It may take a moment to reflect
On Devnet, transactions usually reflect within seconds, but occasionally it may take a bit longer. Try reloading the Slush screen.

## Success Criteria

You've completed this lesson if you can:

- Successfully execute a transfer using `sui client ptb`
- Obtain the `Transaction Digest`
- Verify the transaction status in `Explorer (Suiscan)` / `PTB Builder`
- Confirm balance changes on both the sender and recipient sides

---

## Common Issues

### "Insufficient gas" error

Your account doesn't have enough SUI to pay for gas. Get additional tokens from the [Faucet](/docs/getting-started/L06-get-test-tokens).

### "Invalid address" error

- Make sure the recipient address is correct (it should start with `0x`)
- Check that there are no extra spaces or characters

### Transaction shows "Failed"

- Check the error message in the transaction details
