# Combine Two Operations

In this lesson, you'll use PTB Builder to **build a PTB from scratch that combines two transfer operations into a single transaction**. **It's not difficult**—follow the steps and you'll have it done in no time.

## What is a PTB (Programmable Transaction Block)?

On Sui, you can combine multiple operations into **a single transaction**. This is called a **PTB (Programmable Transaction Block)**.

Using a PTB gives you the following benefits:

- **Save on gas fees (mainly overhead)** — Instead of splitting operations into multiple transactions, you can consolidate signatures and base costs into one
- **Atomicity** — Either all operations succeed, or they all fail (no half-finished states)
- **Efficient** — Complete multiple operations with a single signature

:::tip How PTB works
If you send "1 SUI to A" and "2 SUI to B" separately, you need 2 signatures and pay gas fees twice.
With a PTB, you only need 1 signature and 1 gas fee.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lesson, make sure you have completed the following:

- [Installed Slush wallet](/docs/getting-started/L01-install-slush)
- [Switched to Devnet](/docs/getting-started/L02-switch-devnet)
- [Got test tokens from Faucet](/docs/getting-started/L06-get-test-tokens)

## Build Two Transfers with PTB Builder

The visual editor below is **empty**—only the `Start` and `End` nodes are present.

Follow the **guide** in the top-left corner to add and connect nodes, building two transfer operations into a single transaction.
First, connect your **Slush wallet** using the wallet icon in the top-right corner of the site header.

<BrowserOnly>
  {() => <PtbBuilderDemo answerTemplateId="double-transfer" tutorialId="double-transfer" />}
</BrowserOnly>

## Verify in Explorer

After executing the transaction, verify the results in Explorer:

1. Click the link next to the displayed Transaction Digest
2. Suiscan (or another Explorer) will open
3. In the **Transactions** section, confirm that two TransferObjects operations are included

---

## Verify Success

You've completed this lesson if you can check off the following:

- [ ] Added nodes to an empty PTB Builder and built a two-transfer PTB
- [ ] Connected the gas node to two SplitCoins
- [ ] Executed everything as a single transaction
- [ ] Confirmed in Explorer that two transfer operations are included

---

## Common Issues

### Wallet won't connect

- Make sure the Slush wallet browser extension is installed
- Make sure the network is set to Devnet
- See [L07: Connect Wallet to PTB Builder](/docs/learn/beginner/L07-connect-wallet-to-ptb-builder) for details

### Execute button is not clickable

- Make sure your wallet is connected
- Make sure all nodes are properly connected
- The flow must be connected without breaks from Start to End

### Transaction fails

- Make sure you have enough gas balance
- The balance of the source SUI coin (gas) must exceed the total transfer amount plus gas fees
- If your balance is insufficient, get more SUI from the [Faucet](/docs/getting-started/L06-get-test-tokens)
