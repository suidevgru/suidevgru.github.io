# Create a Move Project

In this lesson, you'll use the **Sui CLI** to create a new Move project and explore the generated file structure. **It's not difficult**—just one command and you're ready to go.

## Why Create a Move Project?

To develop smart contracts on Sui, you need a **Move package**. A Move package is a project structure that manages your smart contract code and configuration.

Using the `sui move new` command:

- **Automatically generates** all the necessary files and folders
- Creates `Move.toml` (the package configuration file)
- Sets up the `sources/` directory (where you write your code)
- Gets you ready to start developing smart contracts right away

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lesson, make sure you have completed the following:

- [Installed Sui CLI](/docs/getting-started/L03-install-sui-cli)
- [Installed the Sui Extension for VSCode](/docs/getting-started/L04-vscode-sui-extension) (recommended)

:::tip
If you have Sui CLI installed, you're all set. Run `sui --version` in your terminal to confirm it shows a version number.

## Let's Create a Move Project

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Working Directory

First, navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. In this example, we'll create a `sui-projects` folder under your home directory.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/sui-projects
cd ~/sui-projects
```

### Step 2: Run the sui move new Command

Run the following command to create a new Move project. You can replace `my_first_package` with any name you like.

```bash
sui move new my_first_package
```

:::info Package Naming Rules
- Snake case (lowercase with underscores) is recommended (e.g., `my_first_package`)
- CamelCase like `MyPackage` also works
- Cannot start with a number (e.g., `1abc` is not allowed)
- Hyphens are not allowed (e.g., `my-package` is not allowed)
:::

### Step 3: Explore the Generated Folder

Once the command succeeds, a folder named `my_first_package` is created. Let's take a look inside.

```bash
ls -la my_first_package
```

The following structure has been generated:

```
sui-projects/
└── my_first_package/
    ├── .gitignore     # Git ignore configuration
    ├── Move.toml      # Package configuration file
    ├── sources/       # Directory for Move source code
    └── tests/         # Directory for test code
```

---

## Open with VSCode + Sui Extension

Open the project folder in VSCode, and the Sui Extension will automatically recognize the Move project, enabling code completion and error checking.

```bash
code my_first_package
```

If the Sui Extension is installed, you'll see a Sui icon in the left sidebar where you can view project information.

:::tip
You can also use VSCode's "Open Folder" feature to select the `my_first_package` folder.

## Verify Success

You've completed this lesson if you can check off the following:

- [ ] Created a project using the `sui move new` command
- [ ] Confirmed that `Move.toml`, `sources/`, and `tests/` were generated
